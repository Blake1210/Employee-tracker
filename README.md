# Employee-tracker

In this challenge I utilized SQL to make a employee tracker database. With this program I am able to see all departments within a company, which managers are in those departments, which employees report to the manager, and all employee salaries as well. 

I am also able to update, add, and remove data from all levels: employee, manager, and department.
